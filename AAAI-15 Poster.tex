    Lifschitz and Turner introduced the notion of the splitting set and provided a method to divide a logic program into two parts.
They showed that the task of computing the answer sets of the program can be converted into the tasks of computing the answer sets of these parts \cite{LifschitzTurner:splitting}.

    \smallskip
    \smallskip
    However, the empty set and the set of all atoms are the only two splitting sets for many programs, then these programs cannot be divided by the splitting method.

   we propose a new splitting method that allows the program to be split into two parts by an arbitrary set of atoms, while one of them, the ``top'' part, may introduce some new atoms.

   We show that the task of computing the answer sets of the program can be converted into the tasks of computing the answer sets of these parts.

   The experiments show that, the splitting result in our method is the same as the result in Lifschitz and Turner's splitting method.

        By considering the \textit{positive body-head dependency graph} of a program,
        the method of computing proper loops can be extended and a larger number of loops could be proved to be not proper.
        We provide an alternative approach.

        \smallskip
        Intuitively, if we can ``remove'' the vertex $body(r_1)$ or $body(r_2)$ in left figure, then the number of loops would be greatly reduced.
        Let the left subgraph be a strongly connected subgraph with $n$ number of atoms and the right subgraph a strongly connected subgraph with $m$ number of atoms,
        after ``removing'',  the number of loops is reduced from $2^{m+n-4} + 2^n+2^m -2$ to $2^n+2^m - 2$.

    Program $P_1$ has three proper loops: $\{q\}$,
    $\{r, q\}$ and $\{p, r, q\}$.

    $\{p, r\}$ and $\{p\}$ are not proper loops as $R^-(\{p, r\}) = \{{p\gets.},\,{r\gets q.}\}$, $R^-(\{p\}) = \{ {p\gets.}, \,$ ${p\gets r.}\}$ and $R^-(\{p, r, q\}) = \{ {p\gets.}\}$.

    $\{r\}$ is not a proper loops as $R^-(\{r\}) = \{ {r\gets p.},\, {r\gets q.}\}$ and $R^-(\{q, r\}) = \{ {r\gets p.}\}$.
